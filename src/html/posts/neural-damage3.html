        <p> Taking a different look on destruction as procees of art creation is what gave life to
            this series. Fascination by patterns we are unconsciously faced with on daily basis was 
            key inspiriation - from layers of street tags to damaged roads and scraped buildings. 
            If it's difficult to appreciate the esthetics of it, we can appreciate life as a expression at least. 
            As each of the elements can be viewed also as a sign of living, because without expression 
            and creation it is just flow of time what defines ours surrondings. 
            
            Damage is 
            term associated with destruction often, in the eyes of design however it can play 
            major role when deciding what is pleasant to our taste. With upcoming decades 
            we might see big growth of the movement as it prefers to re-create and use 
            already existing elements. Also, methods used are often term of interested for 
            random viewer which might find the process as interesting as the result itself. 
            What we can witness as well nowadays is rather opposite journey of artwork in which 
            is the creation itself is major term of interested with result often not so satisfying to 
            experienced eyeballs.

            On the edge of two movements? Being the first one representation for artwork as point of interest 
            and with second one celebrating the process of creation. What could be seen as 
            fascintating is almost exact opposite distinction between two movements in physical world. Subject 
            number one with ink marker, spray can within public space. Action from few seconds to hours is still very quick 
            in terms of resulting longetivity. Second subject on the other side focused days, weeks, months in the 
            process with result scrapped right after it's done or ending with no deeper value.

      </figure>
      <p>Darker perspective of this work allowed to emphatise background urban atmosphere and earthy color contrasts. 
        This is only collage work from this series,
        as it's fed off paper elements. After deeper look you might also find a bit of bloody tones coming from behind.

      <p>Original work, it set the ground for other color variants with dynamic background strokes, contrasting
